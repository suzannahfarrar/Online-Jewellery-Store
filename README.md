# Online-Jewellery-Store

Hey, you! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

This web application is built on PHP. However, it is a pretty old one and I remember creating this during my college years as a part of my curriculum. Since then, my way of coding has changed greatly. I currently make use of a lot of frameworks and do not deviate from using classes, methods and objects.

As a part of my curriculum, I was not taught about the various PHP frameworks that make coding a millions times easier and we did not study in depth about classes and objects. But, I have done several internships since then and worked on various frameworks such as CodeIgnitor, Yii, etc. and that has catapulted my knowledge in PHP to new heights.

For this particular assignment, I had to create an online jewellery web application WITHOUT the OOP concepts and hence, the code in itself is unstructured. However, I wanted to get this up as it has the ability to show how sessions and cookies work on a web application.

Hope you guys do find it useful after all! 
(Oh and take a look at the screenshots too.)
